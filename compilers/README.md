# Installing an OpenMP Offloading Enabled Compiler
This project requires an OpenMP offloading-enabled compiler. The experimental `clang++` 16 compiler offers to offload to both NVPTX, AMD GCN, and AMD HSA backends. Other compilers, such as `g++` 13, require installing an offloading compiler for each target and linking the offloading compiler and the host compiler. Three scripts to install `g++` and `clang++` can be found here to ease the compilation. Note that the installation of `g++` may take several hours.
