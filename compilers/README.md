# Installing an OpenMP Offloading Enabled Compiler
This project requires an OpenMP offloading-enabled compiler. The experimental `clang` 16 compiler offers to offload to both NVPTX, AMD GCN, and AMD HSA backends with just one installation. Other compilers, such as `gcc` 13, requires installing an offloading compiler for each target and linking the offloading compiler and the host compiler. Three scripts to install `gcc` and `clang` can be found here to ease the compilation. Please adjust the `-j` flag to ensure fast installation.
